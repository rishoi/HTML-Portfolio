<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hi, I'm Risha, a beginner web developer with a passion for creating clean, user-friendly websites. I'm currently learning the fundamentals of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and I'm excited to keep exploring front-end and back-end technologies. I enjoy solving problems, experimenting with design, and turning ideas into working web pages. As I continue my learning journey, I'm focused on building real-world projects, improving my coding skills, and becoming a confident full-stack developer one step at a time.
